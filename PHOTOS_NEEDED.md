# Photos Needed for Your Portfolio

To make your portfolio more personal and engaging, here are the photos I recommend:

## Required Photos

### 1. **About Section Photo** (Priority: High)
- **Location**: About section, left side
- **File name**: `about-photo.jpg` (or `.png`)
- **Specs**:
  - **Size**: At least 800x1200px (portrait orientation, 3:4 ratio)
  - **Format**: JPG or PNG
  - **Content**: A nice portrait photo of you
  - **Style**: Professional but approachable - could be:
    - You at a coffee shop
    - You with your musical instruments (piano, clarinet, saxophone)
    - You in a casual professional setting
    - A headshot with good lighting
  - **Where to place**: Save in `public/about-photo.jpg`

### 2. **Hero Section Background** (Optional but nice)
- **Location**: Background of hero section
- **File name**: `hero-background.jpg`
- **Specs**:
  - **Size**: At least 1920x1080px (landscape)
  - **Format**: JPG
  - **Content**: Something subtle and minimal - could be:
    - A blurred photo of your workspace
    - A subtle abstract pattern
    - A photo of Waterloo campus
    - A minimalist architectural shot
  - **Where to place**: Save in `public/hero-background.jpg`

## How to Add Photos

1. **Create a `public` folder** in your project root (if it doesn't exist)
2. **Add your photos** to the `public` folder
3. **Update the About component** - I've already added a placeholder. Just uncomment the Image component and make sure the filename matches

## Photo Tips

- **Lighting**: Natural light works best
- **Background**: Keep it simple and uncluttered
- **Composition**: Center yourself or use rule of thirds
- **Quality**: Use high-resolution images (they'll be optimized automatically)
- **File size**: Try to keep under 2MB per image (Next.js will optimize them)

## Current Status

✅ **About section**: Placeholder ready - just add your photo!
⏳ **Hero background**: Optional - current design works without it

Once you add the photos, the site will automatically use them. The About section photo will really make the site feel more personal and inviting!
